for a self hosted [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) I turned to [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) and [LXD](https://canonical.com/lxd) to create an [LXC container](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/latest/explanation/lxd_lxc/) for [Nextcloud snap](https://github.com/nextcloud-snap/nextcloud-snap). There is a great community behind Nextcloud snap and support is fantastic. The greatness of Linux together with supported hardware enables anyone to run a 24/7 Nextcloud server. 

My goal is a simple safe and reliable setup with ample resources for 5+ family users, affordable, efficient and low maintenence. My day job is software support for a leading WMS. I'm an avid scuba diver and enjoy Linux and FOSS. I'm a dad and husband thus I'm not keen on spending much of my free time doing server-maintenence.

If you would like to give it a try, head over to [SCUBA's Nextcloud snap server setup guide](https://github.com/scubamuc/scubamuc.github.io).

having gained some Nextcloud snap experience I was asked to join the [Nextcloud snap team](https://github.com/nextcloud-snap) to assist in [testing PR's](https://github.com/nextcloud-snap/nextcloud-snap/wiki/Develop-and-contribute#testing-pull-requests), resolving [issues](https://github.com/nextcloud-snap/nextcloud-snap/issues) where possible and creating/mainaining the [Nextcloud snap wiki](https://github.com/nextcloud-snap/nextcloud-snap/wiki). That has certainly been an exciting journey and is a fantastic experience.
